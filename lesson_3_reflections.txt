When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If we are working from different places, different computers or devices (even if they aren't our own devices).


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Changes can cause conflicts. If you are in the process of creating a new feature, you don't want to solve those conflicts but finish your feature first.
