When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	If we are working from different places, different computers or devices (even if they aren't our own devices).


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Changes can cause conflicts. If you are in the process of creating a new feature, you don't want to solve those conflicts but finish your feature first.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub. Use this when you want to make changes to a repository when you don't have access to the original repository.
	A clone is copy of a repository. This can be on the same machine, but it can also be a clone from a GitHub repository to your own machine. Use this for collaborating.
	Branches are leafs on the master branch. Those can be seen as a side track in which you can change code without changing the master branch. Use this for creating new features/bug fixes.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    You can work offline, it saves a lot of data overhead when pushing changes to github and it gives the possibility to do a quick check which changes are made in the online repo compared to the offline repository.
